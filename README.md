# Blockchain-Basics

A site built showing some of the fundamental concepts that make up Blockchain technology.

Built using NodeJs and React, inspiration was taken from https://anders.com/blockchain/ and my "clone"
aims to be visually more appealing and was also used as an excuse to enhance my React knowledge.
